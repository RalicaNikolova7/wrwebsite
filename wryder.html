        <h2>Biografy: </h2>
        
        <p> Winona Laura Horowitz was born on October 29, 1971  in Winona County, Minnesota. She is the daughter of Cynthia, an author and video producer, and Michael Horowitz, a publisher and bookseller. She grew up in a ranch commune in Northern California which had no electricity.  
            Ryder moved with her parents to Petaluma, California when she was ten and enrolled in acting classes. At age 13, she had a video audition to the film Desert Bloom (1986), but did not get the role. However, director David Seltzer spotted her and cast her in Lucas (1986). When telephoned to ask how she would like to have her name appear on the credits, she suggested Ryder as her father's Mitch Ryder & The Detroit Wheels album was playing the background. Ryder was selected for the role of Mary Corleone in The Godfather Part III (1990), but had to drop out of the role after catching the flu from the strain of doing the films Welcome Home, Roxy Carmichael (1990) and Mermaids (1990). She later made The Age of Innocence (1993), which was directed by Martin Scorsese, whom she believes to be "the best director in the world".

        <h2>Trivia:</h2>

        <ul> 
            <li> She suffers from insomnia. She allegedly has had a habit of talking on the phone with actor Al Pacino, who also suffers from insomnia.</li>
            <li> Her agent begged her not to do the comedy Heathers (1988), saying her career would be over. </li>
            <li> Wanted to be a competitive skateboarder when she was younger. </li>
            <li> She owns some of Hollywood's stars' most priceless possessions (Louis Armstrong's bongo drums among others). She also has a collection of vintage Hollywood costumes, including Russ Tamblyn's jacket from West Side Story (1961), Leslie Caron's dress from An American in Paris (1951), Claudette Colbert's gown from It Happened One Night (1934), Olivia de Havilland's blouse from Gone with the Wind (1939), and Sandra Dee's bikini from the "Tammy movies". </li>
            <li> Suffers from aquaphobia because of trauma she suffered at age 12 when she nearly drowned. This caused problems when she had to act in some of the underwater scenes in Alien Resurrection (1997). The scenes had to be reshot numerous times because of this. </li>
            <li> Dropped out of The Godfather Part III (1990). She said in an interview later that year that she arrived in Rome to film and simply could not get out of bed. A doctor was called and ordered her to return home and sleep. </li>
            <li> Had dated Johnny Depp for many years. His original tattoo of her read: "Winona Forever". After they broke up, he had this reduced to "Wino Forever". </li>
            <li> Good friends with Courtney Love and the late Brittany Murphy. </li>
        </ul>

            When asked why is she always playing teenagers, she says: Like, I'm nineteen. What am I supposed to do, play a judge?!
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000213/quotes/?ref_=nm_dyk_qu">
            [on Tim Burton] He gave me my career. Actually, if you think about it, I don't think I would be an actress if Beetlejuice (1988) hadn't come along, because I really wasn't thriving in those auditions. I'd just done a couple things, but I had black hair and was very pale, and that movie led to other things. So yeah, he gave me a career.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000213/quotes/?ref_=nm_dyk_qu">
            I read biographies of the greats, and they were so messed up that I thought I'd better mess myself up. But I couldn't. I'm too small.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000213/quotes/?ref_=nm_dyk_qu">
            For a long time, I was almost ashamed of being an actress. I felt like it was a shallow occupation. People would be watching my every move.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote cite="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000213/quotes/?ref_=nm_dyk_qu">
            Focus should be on the art of film, not on the business of film.
